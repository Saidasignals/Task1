# Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
#Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following:
#1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
#2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:

a = float(input("Enter a number: "))
b = float(input("Enter another number: "))
c = a + b
print("Addition: ",c)
d = a - b
print("Subtraction: ",d)
e = a * b
print("Multiplication: ",e)
f = a / b
print("Division: ",f)
